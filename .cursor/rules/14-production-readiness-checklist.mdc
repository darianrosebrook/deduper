# Production Readiness Verification Checklist

**Before claiming "production-ready", "production-grade", or similar, complete this entire checklist.**

## 🔍 Pre-Claim Verification Process

### □ Code Quality Gates

- [ ] `npm run lint` shows **zero errors** (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
- [ ] `npm run typecheck` passes with **zero TypeScript errors**
- [ ] No TODOs, PLACEHOLDERs, or MOCK DATA in production code (`src/`)
- [ ] No unused imports or dead code
- [ ] Code formatting consistent (Prettier/ESLint rules)

### □ Testing & Quality Assurance

- [ ] `npm test` passes **all tests** (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] **No tests skipped** in production code
- [ ] Coverage meets thresholds: 80%+ lines, 90%+ branches
- [ ] Database integration tests use **real database** (not mocked)
- [ ] All external API integrations tested with real endpoints
- [ ] Mutation testing scores: 70%+ for critical components
- [ ] Performance tests meet documented SLAs

### □ Infrastructure & Persistence

- [ ] **Real database persistence** implemented (not in-memory mocks)
- [ ] Database integration tests pass with real PostgreSQL/MySQL/etc.
- [ ] Migration scripts tested and working
- [ ] Data consistency and transaction handling verified
- [ ] Connection pooling configured and tested
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented and tested

### □ Security & Reliability

- [ ] Security controls tested and validated (auth, authorization, input validation)
- [ ] **Zero security scan violations** (SAST, dependency scans)
- [ ] Circuit breakers implemented for external dependencies
- [ ] Graceful degradation tested under failure conditions
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting and DDoS protection configured

### □ Documentation & Reality Alignment

- [ ] **Documentation matches implementation reality** (no claims of missing features)
- [ ] README installation instructions work on clean environment
- [ ] API documentation current and all endpoints functional
- [ ] Code examples in docs run without errors
- [ ] Architecture diagrams reflect actual code structure
- [ ] Changelog accurate and version numbers correct

### □ Deployment & Operations

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes all stages
- [ ] Deployment automation tested and working
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Environment configuration validated
- [ ] Health checks implemented and working
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured

### □ Scalability & Performance

- [ ] Load testing completed with realistic user counts
- [ ] Response times meet documented SLAs (P95 < defined limits)
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Database query performance optimized
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented and tested
- [ ] Horizontal scaling capability verified

## 🚫 If ANY Item Is Unchecked

**DO NOT claim production readiness.** Instead use:

- ❌ **"In development"** - Active development with known issues
- ❌ **"Partially implemented"** - Some features working, major gaps remain
- ❌ **"Proof of concept"** - Core concept demonstrated, not production-viable
- ❌ **"Beta/Alpha release"** - Limited production use with close monitoring

## 📊 Evidence Requirements

When claiming production readiness, provide:

- [ ] Test execution results (screenshots/logs)
- [ ] Coverage reports showing adequate thresholds
- [ ] Lint results showing zero errors
- [ ] Security scan reports with zero violations
- [ ] Performance benchmark results
- [ ] Database connectivity and migration proofs
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline success evidence
- [ ] Deployment verification logs
- [ ] User acceptance testing results

## 🏆 Production-Grade Status Requirements

### Enterprise Production (Tier 1)

- [ ] 99.9%+ uptime SLA
- [ ] <1 second P95 API response times
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage across all components
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Automated deployment and rollback
- [ ] 24/7 monitoring and incident response
- [ ] Multi-region deployment capability
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging

### Standard Production (Tier 2)

- [ ] 99.5%+ uptime SLA
- [ ] <3 second P95 API response times
- [ ] 85%+ test coverage
- [ ] No high-risk security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Semi-automated deployment process
- [ ] Business hours monitoring
- [ ] Single-region deployment
- [ ] Basic audit logging

### Minimum Viable Production (Tier 3)

- [ ] 99%+ uptime SLA
- [ ] <10 second P95 API response times
- [ ] 70%+ test coverage
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Manual deployment process
- [ ] Basic monitoring
- [ ] Single environment
- [ ] Error logging only

## 🔄 Continuous Verification

### Daily/Weekly Checks

- [ ] All tests still passing
- [ ] No new linting errors
- [ ] Security scans clean
- [ ] Performance within SLAs
- [ ] No breaking changes without documentation updates

### Monthly Reviews

- [ ] Dependency updates applied
- [ ] Security patches deployed
- [ ] Performance optimizations reviewed
- [ ] Documentation accuracy verified
- [ ] Backup/recovery procedures tested

### Quarterly Audits

- [ ] Full security assessment
- [ ] Penetration testing completed
- [ ] Load testing under increased capacity
- [ ] Disaster recovery simulation
- [ ] Compliance requirements verified

## ⚠️ Warning Signs of Unready Code

### Red Flags (Immediate Rejection)

- TODO comments in core business logic
- Console.log statements in production code
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Missing error handling in critical paths
- Database operations without transactions
- API endpoints without authentication
- Tests that mock the system under test
- Documentation claiming 100% coverage with failing tests

### Yellow Flags (Requires Investigation)

- Complex functions > 50 lines
- Classes with > 10 methods
- Files > 500 lines
- Test files with low coverage
- Dependencies without security audits
- Manual deployment processes
- Limited monitoring capabilities

### Green Flags (Positive Indicators)

- Comprehensive error handling
- Transaction-wrapped database operations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Automated testing and deployment
- Security headers and controls
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Clear separation of concerns
- Well-documented APIs and contracts

### Scoring Guide

- **70-85 points**: Production-ready (Tier 1)
- **50-69 points**: Production-viable (Tier 2)
- **30-49 points**: Minimum viable production (Tier 3)
- **0-29 points**: Not production-ready

**Only claim production readiness if scoring 50+ points with all critical categories (Testing, Security, Infrastructure) at 80%+.**
