# Code Freeze Configuration for Deduper Project
# 
# This configuration controls the code freeze quality gate which blocks
# feature commits during crisis response or maintenance periods.
#
# For active development, code freeze is disabled via global override
# in quality-exceptions.json instead of this file.
#
# If code freeze needs to be enabled, use these settings:
# blocked_commit_types: ['feat', 'perf']
# allowed_commit_types: ['fix', 'refactor', 'chore', 'docs', 'test', 'revert']
# max_total_insertions: 500
# max_per_file_insertions: 300
