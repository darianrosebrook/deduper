## Shortcuts & Batch UX
Author: @darianrosebrook

### Shortcuts (proposed)

- Next/Prev group: j / k
- Open group: Enter
- Select keeper (cycle): Space
- Merge current group: Command+M (confirm)
- Undo last merge: Command+Z
- Skip group: Command+S

### Batch Actions

- “Merge all exact duplicates” with confirmation; excludes similar-not-duplicate.
- Batch skip; batch mark “not duplicates”.

### Safeguards

- Confirmation modals; evidence panel accessible via keyboard.
- E2E tests cover shortcuts and batch flows.
