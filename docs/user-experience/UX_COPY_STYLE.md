## UX Copy Style Guide
Author: @darianrosebrook

### Principles

- Simple, precise, and actionable. Offer a next step.
- Consistent voice; avoid jargon; no emojis.
- Redact paths; show base names and parent folders only.

### Patterns

- Titles: Title Case; Messages: sentence case.
- Structure: What happened → Why (optional) → Next step.

### Examples

- Managed library detected — This is a Photos library. Use the guided export → dedupe → re-import workflow.
- Access not granted — We couldn’t access one or more selected folders. Re-authorize to continue.
- Cloud item not downloaded — This file is not available locally. Download first or enable fetching in Settings.

### Writing Checklist

- Is there a clear action for the user?
- Is technical detail minimal and necessary?
- Are we using the standard error code mapping?
